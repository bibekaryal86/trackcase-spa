# trackcase-spa

* Things to ADD
  * react testing library
* From Client Page, give option to create new court case
* In service response, add count of each list of objects (eg: in court add count judges, in judges add count clients, etc)

* when first row is added the page doesn't reload
  * eg: when clients is empty and add new client, it doesn't reload the component to show newly added
  * no issues in adding/updating/deleting after 1st row added

* Court Case -> There's no name, so clientName + courtCaseTypeName
