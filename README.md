# trackcase-spa

* Things to ADD
  * react testing library
  * add pagination to service response
    * similar to check IG/TT API response

* when first row is added the page doesn't reload
  * eg: when clients is empty and add new client, it doesn't reload the component to show newly added
  * no issues in adding/updating/deleting after 1st row added

* table sort might not be working as expected

* when adding a form, do not allow adding to inactive clients or closed cases
* same for task calendar and hearing calendar
* collections should be allowed if there are pending amount

* test getCourtCases works of not by directly calling api
